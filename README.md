## How to install

To install the extension, We recommend using an Extension Manager for your version if your Adobe Flash version permits it, (download the released .zxp and put it in your extension manager)
Otherwise, you can download them manually.

To install them manually, you need to go to <br>``C:\Users\[UserName]\AppData\Local\Adobe\[Flash/Animate version]\[yourLocale]\Configuration\Commands``<br>
Example: ``C:\Users\sotif\AppData\Local\Adobe\Animate 2022\en_US\Configuration\Commands``

With your `zxp` file, rename the extension to `zip` so you can extract the contents, except `BetterTextureAtlas.mxi` (this is only useful for the Extension Managers mentioned before)

After extracting the zip file, you should restart the program if it's currently running, and after that it should pop up in the `Commands` tab.

## How to use the extension

Select the symbol that you wanna export an click `Commands > BetterTextureAtlas`.
A window will show up with different export settings to export your Texture Atlas.
